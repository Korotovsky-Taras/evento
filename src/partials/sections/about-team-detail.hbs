                        <p>Patrick was first introduced to the hospitality industry as a 5-year-old, thanks to his family's business. He eventually worked his way up to Account Executive at Maritz Global Events, where he gained valuable experience in all aspects of event services.</p>
                        <p>While at Maritz, Patrick saw an opportunity to improve the gifting solutions for client programs. He believed gifting could be a more impactful part of each program, because these mementos live on after an event or initiative ends. One of Patrick's favorite Global Evento gifting projects was the Build-A-Bear program, where each guest designed a bear, provided a special message and donated the bear to a children's charity.</p>
                        <p>From being a fisherman in Alaska to a professor in Spain and a nine-time Running of the Bulls participant, Patrick finds new, exciting opportunities no matter where in the world he is located.</p>
